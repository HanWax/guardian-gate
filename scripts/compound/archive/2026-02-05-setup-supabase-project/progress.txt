## Codebase Patterns
- TanStack Start dev server runs on port 3000 by default with `npm run dev`
- agent-browser is used for frontend browser testing and verification

- Verified dev server starts successfully
- Installed agent-browser globally for browser testing
- Confirmed localhost:3000 loads with GuardianGate title and Hebrew text "שלום עולם"
- Files changed: tasks/prd.json, scripts/compound/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - agent-browser must be installed globally first (`npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install`)
  - agent-browser snapshot -i shows interactive elements with refs
  - TanStack Start already has Hebrew RTL content working in the current setup
  - Screenshot verification confirms proper page rendering
