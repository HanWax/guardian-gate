Starting Compound Product Loop - Tool: claude - Model: sonnet - Max iterations: 25

===============================================================
  Iteration 1 of 25 (claude)
===============================================================
Excellent! I've successfully completed T-004 (Verify linting passes). Here's what was accomplished:

## Task T-004 Complete

**What was implemented:**
- Installed ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins
- Created eslint.config.js using ESLint 9+ flat config format
- Added "lint" script to package.json
- Fixed linting errors in existing code:
  - Added React import to NotFound.tsx
  - Removed unused Link import from __root.tsx
- Verified both linting and TypeScript checks pass

**Files changed:**
- package.json (added lint script and ESLint dependencies)
- eslint.config.js (created)
- src/components/NotFound.tsx (added React import)
- src/routes/__root.tsx (removed unused import)

**Quality checks:**
- ✅ `npm run lint` exits with code 0
- ✅ `npm run typecheck` exits with code 0

**Commit:** `feat: T-004 - Configure linting with ESLint`

The PRD has been updated with T-001, T-002, T-003, and T-004 all marked as `passes: true`. Progress has been appended to progress.txt with learnings for future iterations.

  Iteration 2 of 25 (claude)
===============================================================
Task T-005 is complete! The development server is now running successfully on http://localhost:3000/. 

I've verified that:
- The server starts without errors
- It binds to localhost on port 3000
- No fatal errors appear in the console
- The server process is active and responsive

The progress has been committed and logged. There are still more tasks to complete (T-006 through T-015 all have `passes: false`), so another iteration will pick up the next highest priority task.
Iteration 2 complete. Continuing...

===============================================================
  Iteration 3 of 25 (claude)
===============================================================
Perfect! T-006 is now complete and passing. The task verified that:
- Development server responds with HTTP 200 
- Page loads and settles properly
- No fatal console errors (only vite debug and React DevTools info)
- Screenshot confirms the page renders content including the GuardianGate title and Hebrew text

The next highest priority task with `passes: false` is T-007 (Test hot module replacement). There are still more tasks to complete, so the project is not fully done yet.
Iteration 3 complete. Continuing...

===============================================================
  Iteration 4 of 25 (claude)
===============================================================
Excellent! Task T-007 has been completed successfully. 

**Summary:**
- Verified HMR is working in the TanStack Start development environment
- Modified src/routes/index.tsx to test automatic browser updates
- Browser updated within 3 seconds without manual refresh
- Server logs confirmed HMR updates with "[vite] (client) hmr update" messages
- Screenshots captured before and after changes
- Committed the PRD and progress updates

The task passes all acceptance criteria, and there are more tasks remaining with `passes: false`, so another iteration will pick up the next task.
