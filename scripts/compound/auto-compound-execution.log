Starting Compound Product Loop - Tool: claude - Model: sonnet - Iterations: 1 to 25

===============================================================
  Iteration 1 of 25 (claude)
===============================================================
Perfect! T-001 is complete. Now checking the PRD again, there are still tasks with `passes: false`, so I'll end my response normally to allow another iteration to pick up the next task.

**Task T-001 Complete** ✓

Created nursery settings Zod schema with comprehensive validation:
- ✓ Schema file created at `src/lib/schemas/nursery.ts`
- ✓ Validates time fields (HH:mm format) using regex pattern
- ✓ Validates timezone as non-empty string
- ✓ 11 unit tests written and passing
- ✓ All quality checks pass (lint, test, typecheck)

Committed with message: `feat: T-001 - Create nursery settings Zod schema`

The next iteration will pick up **T-002** (Create updateNurserySettings server function).
Iteration 1 complete. Continuing...
