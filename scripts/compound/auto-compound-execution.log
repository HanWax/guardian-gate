Excellent! I've successfully completed T-004 (Verify linting passes). Here's what was accomplished:

## Task T-004 Complete

**What was implemented:**
- Installed ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins
- Created eslint.config.js using ESLint 9+ flat config format
- Added "lint" script to package.json
- Fixed linting errors in existing code:
  - Added React import to NotFound.tsx
  - Removed unused Link import from __root.tsx
- Verified both linting and TypeScript checks pass

**Files changed:**
- package.json (added lint script and ESLint dependencies)
- eslint.config.js (created)
- src/components/NotFound.tsx (added React import)
- src/routes/__root.tsx (removed unused import)

**Quality checks:**
- ✅ `npm run lint` exits with code 0
- ✅ `npm run typecheck` exits with code 0

**Commit:** `feat: T-004 - Configure linting with ESLint`

The PRD has been updated with T-001, T-002, T-003, and T-004 all marked as `passes: true`. Progress has been appended to progress.txt with learnings for future iterations.
Iteration 1 complete. Continuing...

  Iteration 2 of 25 (claude)

Task T-005 is complete! The development server is now running successfully on http://localhost:3000/. 

I've verified that:
- The server starts without errors
- It binds to localhost on port 3000
- No fatal errors appear in the console
- The server process is active and responsive

The progress has been committed and logged. There are still more tasks to complete (T-006 through T-015 all have `passes: false`), so another iteration will pick up the next highest priority task.
Iteration 2 complete. Continuing...
