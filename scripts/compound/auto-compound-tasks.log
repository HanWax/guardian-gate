Perfect! I've successfully converted the PRD to prd.json format with granular, agent-testable tasks.

## Summary

✅ **File created:** `/Users/hannahwaxman/Documents/rolecall/scripts/compound/prd.json`

**Task Breakdown:**
- **12 focused tasks** (ideal granularity: 8-15)
- **Priority order:** Schema → Server functions → Hooks → Route/Form → Validation → Submission → Styling → Quality checks → Navigation → Browser testing
- **Branch:** `compound/nursery-settings-page`

**Task Structure:**
1. **T-001 to T-003:** Backend layer (Zod schema, server function, query hooks)
2. **T-004 to T-008:** Route and UI layer (route file, form component, validation, submission, RTL styling)
3. **T-009:** Quality checks (lint, test, typecheck)
4. **T-010:** Navigation integration (sidebar link with role gating)
5. **T-011 to T-012:** Browser verification (desktop form testing, role-based visibility)

**Key Features:**
- Each task has boolean pass/fail acceptance criteria
- Command-based checks specify exit codes
- Browser interactions specify expected outcomes
- No vague criteria ("verify it works" → specific assertions)
- Role-based visibility separated from form functionality
- All 12 tasks marked `passes: false` and ready for execution

The tasks are ordered by dependency and sized for single-iteration completion. Quality checks are built into the task acceptance criteria.
