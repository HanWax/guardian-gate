Perfect! I've successfully converted the PRD to prd.json format. Here's a summary:

## Summary

**File saved to:** `/Users/hannahwaxman/Documents/rolecall/scripts/compound/prd.json`

**Project:** RoleCall - Managers CRUD  
**Branch:** compound/managers-crud  
**Total tasks:** 20 granular, agent-testable tasks

### Task Breakdown by Phase

**Foundation (T-001 to T-003):** List page setup and display
- Route creation and auth protection
- Manager fetch with nursery join and table rendering
- Add Manager button

**Create Flow (T-004 to T-007):** Manager creation form and submission
- New route and form structure
- Phone validation (Israeli format)
- Nursery dropdown population
- Manager creation mutation

**Edit Flow (T-008 to T-009):** Manager update functionality
- Edit route and pre-filled form
- Manager update mutation

**Delete Flow (T-010 to T-012):** Manager deletion with confirmation
- Delete button UI
- Hebrew confirmation dialog
- Delete mutation with cache invalidation

**Polish & Verification (T-013 to T-020):** Navigation, RTL, and end-to-end testing
- Navigation link integration
- RTL layout verification
- End-to-end flow testing (create, edit, delete)
- Empty states and loading states
- Quality checks (lint, test, typecheck)

Each task is:
- ✅ **Autonomously verifiable** - boolean pass/fail acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Small enough for one iteration** - focused on one concern
- ✅ **Ordered by dependencies** - investigation first, then implementation, then verification
- ✅ **Machine-testable** - uses specific commands, browser navigation, file checks
