Perfect! I've successfully converted the PRD markdown to prd.json format. Here's the summary:

## PRD Conversion Complete ✓

**File saved to:** `/Users/hannahwaxman/Documents/rolecall/scripts/compound/prd.json`

**Project:** GuardianGate MVP - TanStack Start Initialization  
**Branch:** `compound/tanstack-start-initialization`

**Tasks Generated:** 15 granular, agent-testable tasks

### Task Breakdown by Phase:

1. **Project Setup (T-001 to T-007)** - Create project, install deps, verify compilation, dev server
2. **RTL Configuration (T-008 to T-011)** - Configure Hebrew RTL support, CSS logical properties, create test page
3. **Project Organization (T-012 to T-013)** - Folder structure and documentation
4. **CI/CD Pipeline (T-014 to T-015)** - GitHub Actions workflow setup

Each task has **boolean pass/fail acceptance criteria** that an AI agent can verify autonomously:
- Command exits (e.g., `npm run typecheck` exits with code 0)
- File existence checks
- Browser navigation and content verification using agent-browser
- Console error validation
- Screenshot verification

All tasks have `passes: false` and are ready for execution in the compound engineering workflow.
