PRD successfully generated and saved to `tasks/prd-setup-supabase-project.md`.

The PRD includes:
- 5 focused tasks that can be completed in 2-4 hours total
- Explicit scope boundaries (NO database migrations or schema changes)
- Verifiable acceptance criteria for each task
- Browser verification for the connection test (T-005)
- Clear functional requirements and non-goals
- Environment variable documentation to prevent secret leakage

Each task is small and independently verifiable, making it suitable for systematic implementation. The PRD is ready for conversion to `prd.json` using the tasks skill when you're ready to begin implementation.
