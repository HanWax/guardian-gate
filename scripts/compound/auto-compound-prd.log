Perfect! I've created the PRD for the nursery settings page at `tasks/prd-nursery-settings-page.md`.

## Summary

The PRD breaks down the feature into **4 focused tasks**:

1. **T-001:** Create Zod schema and server functions for validation and persistence
2. **T-002:** Build React Query hooks following existing patterns
3. **T-003:** Implement the settings route and form component
4. **T-004:** Add navigation link to sidebar (admin/manager only)

Each task has clear, verifiable acceptance criteria and includes browser testing where UI is involved. The PRD explicitly calls out:

- ✅ No database migrations needed
- ✅ Follows existing CRUD patterns (children/parents/teachers)
- ✅ 3-tier architecture (schema → server → queries)
- ✅ Hebrew RTL with logical CSS properties
- ✅ Role-based access (admin/manager only)
- ✅ Completable in 2-4 hours

The PRD is ready for conversion to `prd.json` and execution using the `/tasks` skill when you're ready to implement.
