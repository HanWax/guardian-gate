Perfect! I've successfully updated the PRD for TanStack Start Project Initialization. Here's what I did:

## PRD Created Successfully

The PRD has been saved to `tasks/prd-tanstack-start-initialization.md` with the following key improvements:

### Key Features:

1. **5 Focused Tasks** (meets the 3-5 requirement):
   - T-001: Initialize TanStack Start project with TypeScript
   - T-002: Verify dev server starts successfully
   - T-003: Configure Hebrew RTL support
   - T-004: Create basic project structure and README
   - T-005: Add basic CI/CD pipeline configuration

2. **Scope Control**:
   - Explicitly excludes database work (as required)
   - No authentication, state management, or testing frameworks
   - Focuses solely on project initialization and RTL support

3. **Verifiable Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Each task has specific, measurable criteria
   - Quality checks for all tasks
   - Browser verification for UI-related tasks (T-002, T-003)

4. **Clear Functional Requirements**:
   - 7 numbered, unambiguous requirements (FR-1 through FR-7)
   - Cover framework choice, TypeScript, RTL, structure, and CI/CD

5. **Technical Guidance**:
   - Specific recommendations for RTL implementation
   - Project structure template
   - CI/CD approach

The PRD is now ready to be converted to executable tasks using the tasks skill. This foundation will enable all subsequent GuardianGate MVP development work.
