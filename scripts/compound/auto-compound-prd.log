Perfect! I've created a comprehensive PRD for the Managers CRUD feature and saved it to `tasks/prd-managers-crud.md`.

## Summary

The PRD breaks down the Managers CRUD implementation into **5 focused tasks**:

1. **T-001:** Managers list page at /managers
2. **T-002:** Create form at /managers/new
3. **T-003:** Edit form at /managers/$managerId/edit
4. **T-004:** Delete functionality with Hebrew confirmation
5. **T-005:** Navigation and polish

Each task has clear, verifiable acceptance criteria including browser verification. The PRD emphasizes:

- **No database changes** (managers table already exists)
- **Pattern reuse** from teachers CRUD for consistency
- **Hebrew RTL UI** throughout
- **Israeli phone validation** matching existing patterns
- **Admin-only access** with requireAuth protection
- **2-4 hour completion** target with small, focused tasks

All functional requirements are numbered and unambiguous, and the non-goals section clearly defines scope boundaries to prevent feature creep.
