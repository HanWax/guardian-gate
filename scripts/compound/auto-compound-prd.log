PRD created successfully at `tasks/prd-configure-supabase-auth.md`

The PRD defines 5 focused tasks for configuring Supabase Auth with magic link authentication:

1. **T-001**: Configure Supabase client with Hebrew error messages
2. **T-002**: Create login page with magic link form
3. **T-003**: Create auth callback handler for magic link verification
4. **T-004**: Implement protected route middleware
5. **T-005**: Add role configuration and React context

Each task includes specific, verifiable acceptance criteria and browser testing requirements. The PRD respects the constraints (no database migrations, 2-4 hour scope) and focuses on configuration-level work that enables subsequent features.
